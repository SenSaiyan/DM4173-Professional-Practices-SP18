# ASSIGNMENT: Professional Networking

During the course of the semester, each student must attend a professional social gathering or event (e.g. gallery opening, professional association meet-up, discussion forum) in order to meet other members of their anticipated professional / creative community. The goal of this exercise is to identify those organizations and events for professional networking and then gain experience talking informally to this community about the work that you do. You will need to submit a brief written description of the experience as well as one business card (or some other evidence) of someone you met at the event.
